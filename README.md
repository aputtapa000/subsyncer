# Subtitle Synchronizer Documentation

## Overview
The Subtitle Synchronizer is a Python-based GUI application designed to help users synchronize subtitle files (.srt) with video files. It provides an intuitive interface for adjusting subtitle timings while previewing the video. 100% written by AI (using 4o and Perplexity AI).

## Features
- Load video and subtitle files.
- Synchronize subtitles with video playback.
- Save synchronized subtitles to a new file.
- Resume progress from the last session.
    - Now fixed!
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation and synchronization.
    - This could also be better.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Required Python libraries: `tkinter`, `vlc`.
- VLC media player installed on your system.

## How to Run

### Windows
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install VLC media player from [videolan.org](https://www.videolan.org/).
3. Install the `python-vlc` library by running:
   ```
   pip install python-vlc
   ```
4. Save the script as `syncer.py`.
5. Run the script using:
   ```
   python syncer.py
   ```

### macOS
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install VLC media player from [videolan.org](https://www.videolan.org/).
3. Install the `python-vlc` library by running:
   ```
   pip install python-vlc
   ```
4. Save the script as `syncer.py`.
5. Run the script using:
   ```
   python3 syncer.py
   ```

### Linux
1. Install Python from your package manager or [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install VLC media player from your package manager or [videolan.org](https://www.videolan.org/).
3. Install the `python-vlc` library by running:
   ```
   pip3 install python-vlc
   ```
4. Save the script as `syncer.py`.
5. Run the script using:
   ```
   python3 syncer.py
   ```

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Space`: Sync the current subtitle.
- `Left Arrow`: Go back to the previous subtitle.
- `Right Arrow`: Load the next subtitle.
- `[` : Jump back 5 seconds.
- `]` : Jump forward 5 seconds.

## Testing
The program creates a `*_synced.srt` file so as to not mess with the original srt file. To test playback, you should select the synced srt file either through your video player or by renaming or making a copy of your video file to match the subtitle file's title.

## Limitations
- The application currently supports only `.srt` subtitle files.
- The application currently supports `.mkv`,`.mp4`, and `.avi` video file formats. There is no limitation to the length of the video files, however.
- The application cannot handle `.mkv` files with subtitles built-in to the container. Consider using something like [this](https://github.com/Darkfall48/MKV-Sub-Extractor) to extract the subtitles from the file if this is the case.
- Requires VLC media player to be installed and properly configured.
- The GUI may not scale well on very high-resolution displays.
- Limited error handling for corrupted subtitle files.
- It should be noted that the code was written with Windows in mind... testing on other operating systems has not been conducted.

## Future Improvements
- Support for additional subtitle formats.
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback.
- Improved GUI scaling for different screen resolutions.
- ~~Resume/progress system is finicky. WIP.~~ Fixed!
- Making keyboard shortcuts more robust.
